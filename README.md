Do you have a LOAD of movies on your hard drive ? I have :laughing: 

I am huge fan of movies from 90s, 80s, 70s, 60, ... up to the old school black and white ones. Unfortunately, they were scattered around `Movie` folder on my Seagate external hard drive.  

So one day I have decided to beautify the folder by classifying and moving all the movies into the right **Genre** folders. Being a lazy person I have decide to use **Python** to do all the hard work :blush:

## Table of contents

The task at hand is to find a good API that can classify the movies by genre.

After that each folder is going to have the name of unique genre (Western, Horror, Thriller ...).
